      <h2>Roadmap to Data Structures and Algorithms Mastery</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>1. Establish Fundamentals</h3>
      <p>
        Begin by understanding basic concepts in programming and mathematics.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>2. Learn the Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Start with fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists,
        stacks, and queues. Understand their operations, implementations, and
        time complexity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>3. Master Algorithmic Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        Study and practice common algorithmic techniques such as recursion,
        divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>4. Explore Advanced Data Structures</h3>
      <p>
        Dive deeper into advanced data structures like trees (binary trees, AVL
        trees, red-black trees), graphs, and hash tables. Learn their
        properties, operations, and applications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>5. Understand Sorting and Searching</h3>
      <p>
        Study various sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quick
        sort) and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search). Understand their
        time and space complexity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>6. Practice Problem-Solving</h3>
      <p>
        Solve a wide range of DSA problems on platforms like LeetCode,
        HackerRank, and Codeforces. Focus on understanding problem-solving
        strategies and writing efficient code.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>7. Implement DSA in Real Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Apply your DSA knowledge in real-world projects. Develop applications
        that require efficient data structures and algorithms to solve problems.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>8. Participate in Contests and Competitions</h3>
      <p>
        Participate in coding contests and competitions regularly. They provide
        valuable experience in solving challenging problems under time
        constraints.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>9. Continuously Review and Refine</h3>
      <p>
        Regularly review concepts and algorithms. Keep refining your
        problem-solving skills by tackling increasingly complex problems and
        learning new techniques.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>10. Collaborate and Share Knowledge</h3>
      <p>
        Join online communities, forums, and study groups to collaborate with
        other learners. Share your knowledge and learn from others' experiences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>11. Stay Updated with Latest Trends</h3>
      <p>
        Keep abreast of the latest developments in DSA, including new
        algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. Follow
        research papers, blogs, and tutorials.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>12. Never Stop Learning</h3>
      <p>
        DSA is a vast field with constant advancements. Embrace the journey of
        lifelong learning and continuously strive to enhance your skills and
        expertise.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Embark on your journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms step by
        step, focusing on understanding core concepts, solving diverse problems,
        and applying your knowledge in practical scenarios.
